# Healthcare-SQL-Diagnostics-project-fun
SQL-driven healthcare diagnostics exploring billing integrity, appointment efficiency, and diagnosis frequency. Built for transparency, real-world logic, and future modeling extensions
Overview
This notebook explores healthcare operations through SQL queries and diagnostics, focusing on billing accuracy, appointment throughput, and diagnosis frequency. Built on a simulated multi-table schema, it demonstrates how transparent querying and annotated logic can support better decision-making in healthcare systems.
Objectives
Showcase SQL fluency across joins, aggregations, and conditional logic
Simulate real-world healthcare scenarios with diagnostic commentary
Tie queries to outcomes like billing integrity and patient throughput
Lay groundwork for future modeling (e.g., classification, anomaly detection)
Schema summaries and query modules coming

Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits, the full Medicare dataset is analyzed within the notebook. A reduced sample or aggregated view may be uploaded later. All semantic cleaning, clustering, and visualizations are documented in the notebook. 

Working on updating my README soon.  My viuals and portfolio are updated.  My notebook also needs a refresh.
