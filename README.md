# Healthcare-SQL-Diagnostics-project-fun
SQL-driven healthcare diagnostics exploring the benefits, drugs and drug cost.  Built for transparency, real-world logic, and future modeling extensions
Overview
This notebook explores healthcare operations through SQL queries and diagnostics.  
Showcase SQL fluency across joins, aggregations, and conditional logic (Have not shared much on my initial work yet.0 


Lay groundwork for future modeling (e.g., classification, anomaly detection)
Schema summaries and query modules coming.

Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits, the full Medicare dataset is analyzed within the notebook. A reduced sample or aggregated view may be uploaded later. All semantic cleaning, clustering, and visualizations are documented in the notebook. 

Working on updating my README soon.  My viuals and portfolio are updated.  My notebook also needs a refresh.
